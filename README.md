# Readme
A tech support AI built by Jenish Pathak using the Microsoft Bot Framework.
The original version of Rakesh that I built was built into a snapchat account. I had taken down that AI due to me not having enough time dedicated for it. I currently working on the AI to bring it back as a free service and open-source.
